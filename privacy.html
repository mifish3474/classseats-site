        <p class="muted">Last updated: December 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is a classroom management tool intended for educators. It is designed to keep classroom data under the
          teacher’s control by storing files locally and, optionally, in the teacher’s own Google Drive account.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data You Provide</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats may store information you enter such as student names, seating layouts, attendance marks, notes,
          tags, and other classroom-related data. This information is stored in a JSON file created and managed by you.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Where Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> Data can be stored locally on your device/browser.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google Drive (optional):</strong> If you connect Google Drive, ClassSeats stores files in your Drive.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ClassSeats does not operate a backend database to store your classroom data. There are no ClassSeats servers
          holding your student data.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Google Drive Access</h2>
        <p>
          If you enable Google Drive sync, ClassSeats uses Google OAuth to request access required to save and load your
          ClassSeats files. ClassSeats uses a minimal Drive scope: <code>drive.file</code>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only files created by ClassSeats or explicitly selected by you are accessible</li>
          <li>You may disconnect Google Drive at any time within the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Disconnecting Google Drive stops all Drive access. It does not prevent continued use of ClassSeats with local
          storage.
        </p>

        <h2>5. FERPA &amp; School Policy</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is intended to support educator workflow and does not transmit student data to ClassSeats servers.
          Teachers are responsible for compliance with district policies and applicable laws, including FERPA, for data
          stored in their Google Drive or local device storage.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is designed so that student data remains local or in the teacher’s own Google Drive. No student data
          is transmitted to ClassSeats or external servers. Teachers are responsible for managing access to their devices
          and Google Drive accounts in accordance with school or district policies.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Google API Services Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats’ use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Google API Services User Data Policy,
          including the Limited Use requirements. Google user data is used only to provide and improve user-facing
          features and is not transferred to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          ClassSeats does not use Google user data for advertising, profiling, or analytics unrelated to core ClassSeats functionality.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disconnecting Google Drive</h2>
        <p>You may disconnect Google Drive at any time within the app.</p>
        <p>When disconnected:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ClassSeats will stop accessing your Google Drive</li>
          <li>You may continue using ClassSeats with local storage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is intended for use by educators. ClassSeats does not knowingly collect personal information directly
          from children. Any student data entered into the app is provided by the teacher for classroom management
          purposes and remains under the teacher’s control.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be reflected on this page with a revised
          “Last updated” date.
        </p>
