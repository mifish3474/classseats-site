        <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> <span class="last-updated">February 3, 2026</span></p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how ClassWare Solutions, LLC ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with
          ClassSeats™, a classroom management application for educators to create and manage seating charts, student groupings, attendance,
          and related classroom organization tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not operate backend servers that store student data.</li>
          <li>We do not sell, share, or monetize user data.</li>
          <li>Classroom data is stored locally on the user’s device and/or in the user’s own Google Drive, depending on the user’s settings.</li>
          <li>Student data is not used for advertising or analytics profiling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you do not enable Google Drive sync, ClassSeats stores data locally only. If you disconnect Google Drive access, ClassSeats
          continues to function using local storage.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information ClassSeats Accesses</h2>

        <h3>A. Google Account Information (only if Drive sync is enabled)</h3>
        <p>If you choose to connect Google Drive, ClassSeats requests limited access to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Google account email address (used only to identify the signed-in user)</li>
          <li>Files created by ClassSeats or explicitly selected by you in Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ClassSeats uses the Google Drive <code>drive.file</code> scope, which allows access only to files the app creates or that you
          explicitly open using the app. ClassSeats cannot view, modify, or delete other files in your Google Drive.
        </p>

        <h3>B. Classroom Data</h3>
        <p>Classroom data may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Student names</li>
          <li>Seating arrangements</li>
          <li>Attendance records</li>
          <li>Group assignments</li>
          <li>Teacher-entered notes or alerts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is stored locally on the user’s device and/or in files saved to the user’s own Google Drive (if Drive sync is enabled).
          ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not operate servers that store this data.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>Information is used solely to provide user-initiated features, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saving and loading classroom files</li>
          <li>Displaying classroom data within the app</li>
          <li>Synchronizing files between the user’s devices (when Drive sync is enabled)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data is not used for advertising, tracking, behavioral analytics, or profiling based on student information.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Local data is stored on the user’s device using standard browser or application storage mechanisms.</li>
          <li>When enabled, Google Drive data is stored entirely within the user’s own Google Drive account.</li>
          <li>ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not maintain copies of classroom files on its own servers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because data remains under the user’s control, users may delete, export, or back up files at any time using standard device or
          Google Drive tools.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats does not share classroom data with advertisers, third-party vendors, or analytics platforms that access classroom data.
          Data is shared only when a user explicitly chooses to share files from their own device or Google Drive.
        </p>

        <h2>6. FERPA and Student Privacy</h2>
        <p>ClassSeats is designed to support FERPA-aligned classroom workflows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Student information is controlled solely by the educator (or district-managed account).</li>
          <li>Data remains local or in the educator’s own Google Drive.</li>
          <li>No student data is transmitted to ClassWare Solutions, LLC servers for storage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Educators are responsible for managing access to their devices and Google accounts in accordance with school or district policies.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Google API Services Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats’ use of information received from Google APIs complies with the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the
          Limited Use requirements. Google user data is used solely to provide user-initiated file storage and synchronization features
          and is not transferred to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>Google Drive is a trademark of Google LLC.</p>

        <h2>8. Disconnecting Google Drive</h2>
        <p>You may disconnect Google Drive at any time within the app.</p>
        <p>When disconnected:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No further access to Google Drive occurs</li>
          <li>ClassSeats continues to function using local storage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is intended for use by educators. ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not knowingly collect personal information directly
          from children. Any student data entered into the app is provided by the educator for classroom management purposes and remains
          under the educator’s control.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be reflected on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.</p>
