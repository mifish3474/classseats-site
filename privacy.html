        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> <span class="last-updated">December 13, 2025</span></p>

        <p>
          ClassSeats is a classroom management tool designed for teachers to create and manage seating charts, student groupings,
          attendance, and related classroom organization tasks. Your privacy — and the privacy of your students — is taken seriously.
          This policy explains what data ClassSeats accesses, how it is used, and how it is protected.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>ClassSeats does <strong>not</strong> operate any backend servers.</li>
          <li>ClassSeats does <strong>not</strong> sell, share, or monetize user data.</li>
          <li>All classroom data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and/or <strong>in your own Google Drive</strong>, depending on your chosen settings.</li>
          <li>Student data is not transmitted to ClassSeats or any third party.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you disconnect Google Drive access, ClassSeats continues to function using local storage only.</p>

        <h2>2. Information ClassSeats Accesses</h2>

        <h3>A. Google Account Information</h3>
        <p>If you choose to connect Google Drive, ClassSeats requests limited access to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your Google account email address (used only to identify the signed-in user)</li>
          <li>Files created or explicitly selected by ClassSeats in your Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          ClassSeats uses the Google Drive <code>drive.file</code> scope, which allows access only to files the app creates or that you
          explicitly open using the app. ClassSeats cannot view, modify, or delete any other files in your Google Drive.
        </p>

        <h3>B. Classroom Data</h3>
        <p>Classroom data may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Student names</li>
          <li>Seating arrangements</li>
          <li>Attendance records</li>
          <li>Group assignments</li>
          <li>Teacher-entered notes or alerts</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data is stored locally on your device and/or stored in files saved to your own Google Drive. ClassSeats does not store this
          data on external servers and does not have access to it.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>ClassSeats uses data only to provide core application features, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Saving and loading classroom files</li>
          <li>Synchronizing files between your devices (when Google Drive is enabled)</li>
          <li>Displaying your data within the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data is never used for advertising, analytics profiling, or marketing.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Local data is stored on your device using standard browser or application storage mechanisms.</li>
          <li>Google Drive data is stored entirely within your own Google Drive account.</li>
          <li>ClassSeats does not maintain copies of your files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because data remains under your control, you may delete, export, or back up your files at any time using standard device or
          Google Drive tools.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>ClassSeats does not share data with advertisers, third-party vendors, or analytics platforms that access classroom data.</p>
        <p>Data is shared only when you explicitly choose to share files from your own Google Drive.</p>

        <h2>6. FERPA and Student Privacy</h2>
        <p>ClassSeats is designed to support FERPA-aligned workflows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Student information is controlled solely by the teacher.</li>
          <li>Data remains local or in the teacher’s own Google Drive.</li>
          <li>No student data is transmitted to ClassSeats or external servers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Teachers are responsible for managing access to their devices and Google Drive accounts in accordance with school or district policies.</p>

        <h2>7. Google API Services Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats’ use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the
          Limited Use requirements. Google user data is used only to provide and improve user-facing features and is not transferred to
          third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disconnecting Google Drive</h2>
        <p>You may disconnect Google Drive at any time within the app.</p>
        <p>When disconnected:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>No further access to Google Drive occurs</li>
          <li>ClassSeats continues to function using local storage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is intended for use by educators. ClassSeats does not knowingly collect personal information directly from children.
          Any student data entered into the app is provided by the teacher for classroom management purposes and remains under the
          teacher’s control.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be reflected on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.</p>
