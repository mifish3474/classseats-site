        <h1>FERPA & Student Data Handling — ClassSeats™</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This page describes how ClassWare Solutions, LLC handles student data in connection with ClassSeats™, a local-first classroom
          management application designed for educators to manage seating charts, attendance, and student groupings while keeping student
          data under the control of the educator and within existing school or district systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is intentionally designed without ClassSeats-hosted student data servers. Student information remains on the educator’s
          device and/or within the Google Drive account chosen by the educator.
        </p>

        <h2>FERPA Alignment</h2>
        <p>ClassSeats is designed to support FERPA-aligned instructional workflows.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not independently collect student information.</li>
          <li>ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not take custody of education records.</li>
          <li>ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not store student data on ClassSeats-controlled servers.</li>
          <li>All student data is entered, stored, and controlled by the educator using the application.</li>
          <li>ClassSeats functions as a teacher-directed instructional tool and operates only at the direction of the educator.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>School Official Context</h2>
        <p>ClassSeats does not operate as a centralized student information system and does not receive or host education records.</p>
        <p>
          When used in a school environment, ClassSeats operates under the authority of the educator and within the permissions of the
          account and device used. ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not independently access, review, or redistribute student data and does not
          exercise control over education records.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Storage & Control</h2>
        <h3>Local storage</h3>
        <p>Classroom data is stored locally on the educator’s device by default.</p>

        <h3>Optional Google Drive sync</h3>
        <p>If enabled by the educator, classroom files are stored in the educator’s chosen Google Drive account for cross-device use.</p>

        <h3>No ClassSeats servers</h3>
        <p>ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not copy, transmit, or store classroom data on ClassSeats-owned servers.</p>

        <h3>Data ownership</h3>
        <p>Classroom files are owned and controlled by the educator.</p>
        <p>
          If a district-managed Google Workspace account is used, district policies governing that account (including sharing, retention,
          and security controls) apply.
        </p>

        <h2>Google Drive Access (Optional)</h2>
        <p>If Google Drive sync is enabled, ClassSeats uses the Google Drive API with the drive.file scope.</p>
        <p>This scope:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Limits access to files created by ClassSeats or explicitly selected by the educator</li>
          <li>Does not permit browsing or access to unrelated Drive content</li>
          <li>Operates entirely within the permissions and policies of the Google account used</li>
        </ul>
        <p>ClassSeats does not override or bypass Google Workspace controls applied to the account.</p>
        <p>If Google Drive sync is not enabled, ClassSeats operates using local storage only.</p>

        <h2>Student Accounts & Authentication</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Students do not create accounts in ClassSeats.</li>
          <li>Students do not log in or authenticate.</li>
          <li>Authentication (Google OAuth) is used only when an educator enables Google Drive sync.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Analytics & Redisclosure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not run analytics on student data.</li>
          <li>Student data is not used for advertising, profiling, or secondary purposes.</li>
          <li>ClassWare Solutions, LLC does not redisclose student information to third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Account & District Context</h2>
        <p>ClassSeats respects the security and governance controls of the account used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When an educator uses a personal Google account, data remains under that educator’s control.</li>
          <li>
            When an educator uses a district-managed Google Workspace account, district policies governing Drive usage, sharing, retention,
            and device security apply.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>ClassSeats does not alter or interfere with these controls.</p>

        <h2>Summary for Schools & Districts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No ClassSeats student data servers</li>
          <li>No student accounts</li>
          <li>No analytics or profiling</li>
          <li>Optional, file-level Google Drive access</li>
          <li>Student data remains under educator control and within the account used</li>
        </ul>
