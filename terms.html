        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: December 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
        <p>
          By using ClassSeats, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the application.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Intended Use</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is intended for use by educators and school staff for classroom management. You are responsible for
          ensuring your use complies with your school or district policies and applicable laws.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats stores class data locally on your device and, if you choose to connect Google Drive, in your own
          Google Drive account. ClassSeats does not store student data on its own servers.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Google Drive Sync</h2>
        <p>
          If you connect Google Drive, ClassSeats uses Google OAuth and a minimal Drive scope (<code>drive.file</code>) to
          save and load your ClassSeats files. You may disconnect Google Drive at any time within the app.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use ClassSeats only for lawful purposes and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not attempt to access data that does not belong to you</li>
          <li>Do not reverse engineer or disrupt the application</li>
          <li>Do not use the service in violation of applicable laws</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Availability and Changes</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or
          error-free operation. Features may be updated, modified, or discontinued at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          ClassSeats may introduce paid features or subscription options in the future. Continued use of any free features will be subject to the Terms in effect at that time.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, ClassSeats is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express
          or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
          non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, ClassSeats will not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential,
          or special damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the application.
        </p>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining backups of your data.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of ClassSeats after changes are posted constitutes
          acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>
