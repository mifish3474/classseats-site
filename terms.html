        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> <span class="last-updated">December 13, 2025</span></p>

        <p>
          These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of ClassSeats. By accessing or using ClassSeats, you agree to these Terms.
          If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the application.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is a classroom management tool designed for educators. It allows users to create and manage seating charts,
          student groupings, attendance records, and related classroom organization data.
        </p>
        <p>
          ClassSeats operates as a <strong>local-first application</strong>. Data is stored locally on your device and, if you choose to
          enable it, within your own Google Drive account. ClassSeats does not operate backend servers that store classroom data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is intended for use by educators and other authorized school personnel. You are responsible for ensuring that
          your use of ClassSeats complies with your school, district, or organizational policies.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of ClassSeats is subject to the ClassSeats Privacy Policy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ClassSeats does not sell or monetize user data</li>
          <li>Classroom data remains under the user’s control</li>
          <li>Data is stored locally and/or in the user’s own Google Drive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are responsible for safeguarding access to your device and Google account.</p>

        <h2>4. Google Drive Integration</h2>
        <p>If you choose to connect Google Drive:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ClassSeats requests limited access using the Google Drive <code>drive.file</code> scope</li>
          <li>Only files created by ClassSeats or explicitly selected by you are accessible</li>
          <li>You may disconnect Google Drive at any time within the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Disconnecting Google Drive stops all Drive access and does not prevent continued use of ClassSeats with local storage.</p>

        <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree to use ClassSeats only for lawful purposes and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do not attempt to access data that does not belong to you</li>
          <li>Do not reverse engineer or disrupt the application</li>
          <li>Do not use the service in violation of applicable laws</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Availability and Changes</h2>
        <p>
          ClassSeats is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or
          error-free operation. Features may be updated, modified, or discontinued at any time.
        </p>

        <p>
  ClassSeats may introduce paid features or subscription options in the future.
  Continued use of free features is subject to the terms in effect at that time.
</p>


        <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, ClassSeats is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,
          including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, ClassSeats shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or special
          damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the application.
        </p>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining backups of your data.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms may be updated from time to time. Continued use of ClassSeats after changes are posted constitutes
          acceptance of the updated Terms.
